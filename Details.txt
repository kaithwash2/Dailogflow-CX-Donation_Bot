As I submitted my idea, I have built donation helper bot which can be used by people interested to make and receive donations. 

The bot is mainly based on five donation categories - money, food, medical, clothes and covid. However, it is not restricted to these categories and 
users can provide additional details if needed.

Receivers can submit details about the things they need for donation and donors can search for those details. 
The bot is built to interpret a single user response containing multiple parameters. For example, the donor can opt to get donation details for
both medicines and clothes in a single go and receivers can opt to submit donation details for both covid and food in a single go.

Backend business logic and webhook integration is not done yet. It is only the conversation flow. Donors would receive dummy data for now.

I hope you enjoy talking to donation helper bot.
